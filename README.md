# Python-Learning
This is a series of codes and even workbooks that I wrote as I decided to improve my Python skills. The first ones are codes to practice the foundation, but over time, more interesting projects will appear. It serves as a learning log. a series of codes. As time goes on I hope the projects will become much more advanced.
